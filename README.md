# Miscellaneous
Some programs written for university. 

Includes:
- PJCC Election software for implementing AV voting system for committee elections
- Software for intelligently allocating master's projects to physics students based on their ordered preferences. This is now used by the Oxford Physics department, and 
reduced the number of students getting a project they didn't ask for from ~30% to <1%.
